Welcome to Animal Cards

This is a toy/learning project, so it is, of necessity, basic in many ways. I've been running it from Gradle, so
there is no application form for any platform.

Currently, what is implemented uses cards with animal images for:
* A card matching/memory game
* A sequence remembering game (similar to the old Simon game device)

Please note: To the best of my knowledge, all image files used are in the public domain. If this is incorrect,
let me know and I will remove the offending image(s).
